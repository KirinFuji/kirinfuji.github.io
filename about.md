# About page

Hi there, my name is Kirin.

    I have a passion for information security and have been studying and working with a large range of information technology throughout my life. Due to life being what it is I haven't exactly had the chance to fully pursue my interests, but I have several penetration testing badges and working towards a Certificate in Ethical Hacking. I hope to be able to find a career in one of the many security fields that exist.
