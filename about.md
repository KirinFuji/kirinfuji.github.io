# About page

Hi there, my name is Kirin.

I have always had a passion for learning information security and have been studying and working with a large range of information technology throughout my life. Due to life being what it is I haven't exactly had the chance to fully pursue my interests, however I have recently completed several penetration testing badges and obtained a certificate in Ethical Hacking from a University. 

I enjoy playing games that can be modified extensively like Minecraft and random programming projects in python, c#, and lua.
